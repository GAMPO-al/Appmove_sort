## New sorting algorithm that will  dominate the world
It seems like the algorithm uses time complexity of O(n) where n is the size of the list in the worst case scenario it is still O(n)  and space complexity is O(l) where l is the lenght of the new liste **feel like joma (Jome_Tech)** **Obsecure**  Note: I hope you get the joke I am not sure of what I have said is true I am a newbie to Big O notation so any tip is welcome
